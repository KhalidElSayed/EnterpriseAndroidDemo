These are the artifacts from my talk at AnDevConIV

To create an eclipse project for the code, simply copy the files:

$ROOT/tools/ide/eclipse/project

and

$ROOT/tools/ide/eclipse/classpath

to the root ($ROOT) of the project, named .project and .classpath, respectively.

Then use File > Import > Existing Project into Workspace

The file EnterpriseAndroid.html is the talk slide deck.
